Many, many thanks to the following people, without whom this project would not exist:
* The SimPy team, who has created an amazingly simple yet powerful DES library.
* Giovanni Lagorio, my teacher, who accepted my project and helped me realize it.
* My family, Renata, Giuseppe and Matteo, and the girl I love, Marta, because they kept me happy during all the development.
* Ilaria Bernardini, my cousin, who created the beatiful icon this project has.
